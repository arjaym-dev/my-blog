      <div className="my-5">
        <p className="mb-3">
          It all started during my college days! On my first year college i
          really dont pay attention to all of my major subject when it comes to
          programming it's weird right! I'm IT yet i don't have the motivation
          to pursue it that time.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Then i experience this feeling that, Why i can't understand it! Maybe
          this is not for me, so what i did was focus on playing games I got
          addicted to it playing mobile legends with friends, hangout with them
          as always, sometimes i do cutting classes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          Then when we're already at our last year, we somehow managed to
          survive our capstone that time. Then OJT (Internship) comes suddenly i
          felt what kind of work that I'll be working on in the future, then the
          first word that comes to my mind was to be Web developer
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          After that day, I quit playing games, avoid distractions, and keep
          grinding. Even though it's hard to forget the memories of having an
          easy peasy lifestyle that only revolves to nothing and also will
          result to nothing if i keep doing that kind of things.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          I start learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT at first it's very hard but
          sooner i get the hang of it. GOOGLE and YOUTUBE is my friend that
          time, then i learn to join programming community, wherein i got to
          learn new skill, enhance my knowledge in being a developer
        </p>

        <p>
          And not so long, i start to notice my skill has improved a lot, then i
          start freelance, doing personal project, then got my first full-time
          job as a frontend developer.
